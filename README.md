ChainSDI: A Software-Defined Infrastructure for Regulation-Compliant Home-Based Healthcare Services Secured by Blockchains

Healthcare networking and computing infrastructure
is rapidly changing from closed environments to open environments
that incorporate ubiquitous medical devices and novel application
scenarios. For example, home-based healthcare involves the collection and analysis of data from pervasive sensors (often in real
time) to guide therapy or to perform medical interventions. In
this article, we address the challenges of data interoperability and
regulatory compliance when designing and deploying healthcare
applications in a heterogeneous home-edge-cloud environment. We
propose the ChainSDI framework that leverages the blockchain
technique along with abundant edge computing resources to manage secure data sharing and computing on sensitive patient data.
We implement programmable ChainSDI application programming
interfaces to facilitate the specification of home-based healthcare
services running on a software-defined infrastructure (SDI). This
article is a collaboration between computer scientists, medical
researchers, healthcare IT professionals as well as healthcare
providers with the goal of increasing the availability of SDI infrastructures while meeting the performance and regulatory requirements of healthcare applications. Our prototype demonstrates the
feasibility of the framework and serves as a testbed for novel experimental studies in the context of emerging healthcare applications.
